We actually have reworked two dashboards into new interactive prototypes in Figma links below:\n -	Item Usage dashboard: {item_usage_link}\n -	Item Views dashboard: {item_views_link} \n  o	Item health dashboard is currently being iterated on \n\nASK: Can you please review the new prototypes at the links above and provide feedback?  \n-	NOTE: there is NO updated data so you canâ€™t see your product, we want you to be more focused on the usability / simplicity / metrics / etc.\nThe links to current marketplace item dashboards are in the Curator Home in PMck, with the panel on the left side to change between the different dashboards: {old_dashboard_link}\n\nThanks,\nJoe Apollo"
